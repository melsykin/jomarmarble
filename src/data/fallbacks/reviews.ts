    comment: "Great selection, professional and thorough work/finish, friendly customer service. Jomar Marble & Granite is great. From the time I went to pick out my countertop, to when they came to take measurements and template, to installation- the communication and dealings were professional and friendly. They went above an beyond for me. Especially thanks to Jorge, Nelly and Martha. Will definitely do business with them again.",
